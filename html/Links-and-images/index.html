    <h1>Goats: Versatile Creatures of the Animal Kingdom</h1>
    <a href="./Links/goats.html" target="_blank">Learn About Goats!</a>
    <p>Goats are fascinating creatures that have played a significant role in human civilization for thousands of years. These hardy animals belong to the genus Capra and are closely related to sheep. With their distinctive horns, curious personalities, and remarkable adaptability, goats are valued for their contributions to agriculture, culture, and ecosystems around the world.</p>
    <h2>Physical Characteristics and Adaptability:</h2>
    <p>Goats are medium-sized mammals characterized by their slender build, cloven hooves, and bearded chins. Their coats come in a variety of colors and patterns, ranging from solid black, white, or brown to speckled and multicolored variations. One of the most distinctive features of goats is their horns, which can be straight, curved, or spiraled, depending on the breed.</p>
    <p>These animals are incredibly adaptable, thriving in diverse environments such as arid deserts, mountainous terrains, and lush pastures. Their ability to graze on a wide range of plants, including shrubs and tough grasses, makes them particularly valuable in regions where other livestock might struggle to find adequate forage.</p>
    <h2>Economic and Agricultural Importance</h2>
    <p>Goats have been domesticated for over 10,000 years and are a cornerstone of subsistence farming in many parts of the world. They are prized for their versatility, providing milk, meat, fiber, and hides. Goat milk is highly nutritious and is often used to make cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products. In regions where cow milk is less common, goat milk serves as a crucial dietary staple.</p>
    <p>The meat of goats, known as chevon or mutton (in the case of older animals), is a popular source of protein in many cultures. Additionally, certain breeds, such as the Angora and Cashmere goats, are renowned for their luxurious fibers, which are used to create high-quality textiles.</p>
